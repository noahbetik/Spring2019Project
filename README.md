# Spring 2019 Project
Independent engineering design project for spring 2019, with goal of creating a turret that has two degrees of freedom to acquire a target using vision processing and/or LiDAR and then launch a projectile. Materials used include a LEGO EV3 kit and a Raspberry Pi 3B.

All motion control is coded in python. Using the EV3 requires the EV3Dev2 library; more info can be found here: https://www.ev3dev.org
